# Introduction to LitProg

LitProg is a [markdown][ref_wiki_markdown] based and language agnostic[^languages_caveat] literate programming tool. A literate program is written, first and foremost, to be understood by people and not merely to be valid input for a compiler or interpreter.


## LitProg Example

TODO: most bare bones explanation of what LitProg does and examples
LitProg parses markdown files, extracts program code from fenced code blocks, weaves together a program, validates that program,   HTML,  and 

## The Promise of LitProg

Readers of html/pdf documents generated by LitProg should be convinced that

 1. The document is the whole program.
 2. The document only exists, because it is internally consistent.
 

## Glossary

- [Input] Source Files: Markdown based inputs
- [Output] Code Files: An artifact generated from fenced code blocks
- [Output] Documents: HTML or PDF files



`litprog` parses markdown and generates outputs in these
formats:

 1. `src`: Source code files, from code blocks
 2. `doc`: Static HTML files
 3. `pdf`: PDF files (in A4, Letter, Booklet)

It supports the following markdown extensions

 - Footnotes
 - Paragraph with css class or html node type (admonitions, asside)
 - Diagrams using aafigure
 - Tables
 - Syntax Highlighting using pygments
 - Hyperlinked Source Code (where possible)
 - Math support somehow using MathJax
