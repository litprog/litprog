## Programming Practices


### Parts, Chapters, Summaries and Sections

In the age of reddit and twitter, readers are well trained at
scanning for the content they're interested in. Long paragraphs
of text are only read if their headline has convinced the reader
that it is worth reading. Don't write a paragraph if a bulleted
list will do. Don't write a paragraph if the code speaks for
itself.


### Summaries

A summary is the first (or first few) paragraphs of a chapter. It
is reproduced of course in the chapter text itself, but also in
the "Program Overview" which is generated from the headings and
these summaries. It should be possible for a reader to read the
"Program Overview" and build a mental map of what portion of the
the program can be found in which chapter.


### Footnotes

For links/references only. It should be possible to understand
a text without reading footnotes.


### Asside

For anecdotes or other text not directly related to understanding
the program.
