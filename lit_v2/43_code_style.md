### Positive Thinking (booleans)

To avoid double negatives it helps if variable names are chosen based on the positive case. To negate these you can use the not operator, which will read somewhat naturally. If your variable nambes are negative and you want to check for the positive case, the boolean expression will inevitably contain a double negative.
